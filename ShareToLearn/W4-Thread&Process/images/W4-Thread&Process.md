# Introduction

# Thread & Process

## What?

- **Process** is a program in execution state
- **Thread** is a lightweight process
- A **process** can have multiple **threads**

## Why

## CPU-bound and I/O-bound processes

- A program is **CPU bound** if it would go faster if the CPU were faster
- A program is **I/O bound** if it would go faster if the **I/O subsystem** (disk, networking) was faster
