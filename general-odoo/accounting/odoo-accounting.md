# Basics

- auto create journal entries for each of accounting transactions: customer invoices, POS order, expenses, inventory move, etc
- report income / expense at the time transactions occur (i.e., accrual basis), or when payment is made or received (i.e., cash basis)
- Users can access several companies but always work in one company at a time.
- Every transaction is recorded in the default currency of the company
- Odoo stores both the value in the currency of the company and the value in the currency of the transaction. Odoo can generate currencies gains and losses after the reconciliation of the journal items.
- Odoo also have modules to comply with IFRS rules.
- By default, Odoo uses a single account for all account receivable entries and one for all accounts payable entries.
- Odoo also remembers how you’ve treated other bank statement lines and provides suggested general ledger transactions
- Odoo’s report engine allows you to customize your own report based on your own formulae.
- Calculate the tax you owe your tax authority by Tax Report
- support both periodic (manual) and perpetual (automated) inventory valuations
- calculates your current year earnings in real time so no year-end journal or rollover is required. This is calculated by reporting the profit and loss balance to your balance sheet report automatically.
- costing method:
  - standard price
  - average price
  - lifo
  - fifo (not accepted by IFRS)
- Every financial document of the company (e.g. an invoice, a bank statement, a pay slip, a capital increase contract) is recorded as a journal entry, impacting several accounts
- Reconciliation is performed automatically by the system when:
  - the payment is registered directly on the invoice
  - the links between the payments and the invoices are detected at the bank matching process
- Check handling
  - Two journal entries and a reconciliation

- In order for an exchange difference entry to be created automatically, the corresponding invoices and payments need to be fully reconciled. This means the invoices are fully paid and the payments are fully spent on invoices.
