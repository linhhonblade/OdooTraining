# OIM Project Leader - Onboarding Partners
## The "Odoo Implementation Methodology"
- The "Odoo Implementation Methodology" (a.k.a "QuickStart") is the approach Odoo has chosen over the years.
- fit 80% clients
- but for bigger project (> 100-150 users) on multiple applications &rarr; heavy development
