## Description

Distribution Center/
|
|--Store 1
|--Store 2
|--Store 3
|--Store 4

- Purchasing activities take place in the Central Warehouse (Stores are not allowed to order directly from external suppliers)
- They refill the store shelves directly from central warehouse
- At the launch of the new product range, the purchasing department places a big order to the external suppliers in order to fill in the distribution center with its buffer stock and the stores with the initial amount which was forecasted
- As soon as the order is received at the distribution center, the warehouse department dispatches the goods to the stores following a predetermined repartition
- The long-term supply strategy is then to maintain minimum stock level in the stores for each SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) and act upon the same methodology in the central warehouse

## Summary of needs

- One central warehouse and four remote stores
- Purchase in the central, internal resupply in the stores
- Manual dispatch to the stores at product launch
- Automated resupply on the long run

## Questions

- What would be the preferred set up for this network configuration?
