Web applications were originally developed around a client/server model, where the client is always the initiator of transactions, requesting data from the server. Thus, there was no mechanism for the server to independently send, or push, data to the client without the client first making a request.

To overcome this deficiency, Web app developers can implement a technique called HTTP long polling, where the client polls the server requesting new information. The server holds the request open until new data is available. Once available, the server responds and sends the new information. When the client receives the new information, it immediately sends another request, and the operation is repeated. This effectively emulates a server push feature.
